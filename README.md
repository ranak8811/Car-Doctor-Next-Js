    # Image Upload
    NEXT_PUBLIC_IMGBB_API_KEY=your_imgbb_api_key

    # API Base URL
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_ADDRESS=http://localhost:3000
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### 🧪 Testing Credentials

To test the role-based features, you can use the quick login buttons on the login page or the following credentials:

- **Admin User**:
  - Email: `admin1@gmail.com`
  - Password: `admin1#123`
- **Standard User**:
  - Email: `alex@gmail.com`
  - Password: `alex#123`

## 📦 Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

1.  Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2.  Import the project into [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
3.  **Critical**: Configure the environment variables in Vercel settings exactly as they are in your `.env.local`.
    - _Note_: Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_ADDRESS` matches your production Vercel domain (e.g., `https://car-doctor.vercel.app`).

```

## 🔐 Security Note

This project uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_MONGODB_URI` for configuration ease as per specific user requirements. **For a strict production environment**, it is recommended to keep database credentials server-side only (i.e., `MONGODB_URI` without `NEXT_PUBLIC_`) and proxy requests through API routes to avoid exposing credentials.
